# Development Roadmap

[ ] **JWT:** Routes are not secured right now & anyone can send requests pretending to be another one. Adding JWT will cover this.

[ ] **Handling Group Events:** After removing a group member or leaving, the member must be removed from ledgers.

[ ] **Change DB:** Mongodb is a no-SQL database. Using postgresql would be a better idea in this project while the data is structured.

[ ] **Add bot to attachment menu:** Make it accessible from attachment menu.

[ ] **Easy Settle Up:** Simplify debts in order to make fewer transactions in order to settle-up.

[ ] **i18n:** Add non-English languages & different Currencies.

[ ] **Avatar:** Save users avatars on their registration. 

[ ] **Show Payment List:** Show list of all payments.

[ ] **Aggregate transactions in Bot page or in Saved Messages:** You can manage all of your transactions in one place.
